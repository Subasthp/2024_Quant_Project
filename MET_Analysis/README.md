# Multi-Environment Trial (MET) Analysis
# Guilherme Oliveira, Mandeep Singh, Subash Thapa

Project Overview

The following document was developed by Guilherme Oliveira, Mandeep Singh, and Subash Thapa, students at
South Dakota State University, as a requisite for the PS 746 - Quantitative Genetics course.
The main objective of this project was to conduct Multi Trial Analysis, covering 
# i) GxE analysis (+ GGE analysis) 
# ii) AMMI analysis 
# iii) GGI analysis
# iv) FW analysis 
For parts i, ii, iii, and iv, we are exploring the open dataset made available by Dias et al. (2018), which
contains phenotypic data of five drought tolerance traits measured in 308 hybrids along eight environments
contrasting for water availability. For practical purposes, we are using a subset of 202 hybrids. The traits
analyzed were grain yield (GY), ears per plot (EPP), female and male flowering times (FFT and MFT),
and anthesis-silking interval (ASI). The source code used is from the metan (Olivoto and Lucio, 2020) and
statgenGxE reference manuals.
