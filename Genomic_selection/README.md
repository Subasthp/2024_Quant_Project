# Genomic Selection Analysis
# Guilherme Oliveira, Mandeep Singh, Subash Thapa

Project Overview

The following document was developed by Guilherme Oliveira, Mandeep Singh, and Subash Thapa, students at
South Dakota State University, as a requisite for the PS 756 - Quantitative Genetics course.
The main objective of this project is to conduct Multi-trait genomic selection.

To complete this task, we are exploring the open dataset made available by Crossa et al. 2013 and Montesinos-
Lopez et al. 2016, 2017 which contains the data of 309 double-haploid maize lines conducted in 3 environments
and each environments having 3 reps of each line. The traits analyzed were grain yield (yield), anthesissilking
interval (ASI) and plant height (PH). The source code used is from Montesinos-Lopez et al. 2019
using the BMTME R package, where we did just small modifications, however, bringing more interpretations
and extra analyses.
